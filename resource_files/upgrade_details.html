            <p>
            Version 2.4.x is substationally diffrent from previous versions. The file structure was changed to better organize the content and to 
            improve the performance when expanding the avaialable USB storage.  Because of this, a full re-image of the Raspberry Pi SD card is 
            required to move to the new code base if you are version 2.3.1 or earlier. Plesae download the full image from GitHub.
